Download the executable game [here](https://github.com/LeverageAlex/Arbalest/raw/master/P-Seminar_Informatik.zip).  
Before I start digging into details i want to mention, that this Project has orginally been versionized by Gitlab, so don't wonder that the linked usernames in the commit-history don't match with GitHub. My Username back then was "mlgfat".  

This game was a school project in 11th and 12th class. Our team was made up of 11 students, who can be categorized in seven graphic designer, two "marketing guys", one level designer (Louis) and me, the main coder of this project.

For development of the game, GameMaker served as game engine. It allows to code in GameMaker Language (GML), which is quite similiar to C# and Java.

I wrote >95% of the code, while Louis wholely designed the game with the tools i provided for him. My programming part included coding:
- the player object
- several enemies, e. g. a skeleton, a flying bat, a walking mushroom...
- all environment objects, e. g. flying moving plattforms, cactus trees...
- the shop system
- whole UI   

and a lot more.

Appart from "just coding" I had to ensure, that the graphic designers exactly get the idea of the graphics i demanded from them, which was quite challenging.

I have uploaded several images, so can get an idea of the game.

Overall it took me an estimated 400 hours from start to finish this project. It was a pretty funny and rich experience.
